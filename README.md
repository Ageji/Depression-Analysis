### Data Source

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains  data related to individual demographics, lifestyle choices, and mental health indicators. It includes variables such as age, marital status, employment status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, dietary habits, and medical history, all of which were analyzed to explore their relationship with depression risk.

### Tools

- SQL server(Data Analysis)
- Power BI(Creating Report)

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  EDA involve exploring the depression dataset to answer key question:
  
- How does smoking status influence depression risk, and what is the impact of alcohol consumption levels on depression risk?
- How does alcohol consumption affect the prevalence of chronic medical conditions, and what is its overall impact on depression risk?
- How do demographics (age, marital status, employment status) and lifestyle factors (physical activity, dietary habits) collectively influence depression risk?
-  How do employment status and marital status individually and collectively affect depression risk?
-  How do different dietary habits correlate with depression risk, and are specific dietary patterns associated with higher or lower depression risk?

  ### Results

  - Both smoking and higher levels of alcohol consumption are associated with an increased risk of depression.
- Excessive alcohol consumption correlates with a higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions and contributes to an increased risk of depression.
-  Depression risk is influenced by a combination of demographic factors and lifestyle choices.
- Unemployment and specific marital statuses are associated with a greater risk of depression compared to being employed or married.
- Unhealthy dietary habits are related to a higher risk of depression, while healthier dietary patterns are associated with a lower risk.

### Recommedation

- Develop integrated wellness programs that offer both smoking cessation support and alcohol moderation counseling.
- Encourage individuals with chronic conditions to engage in physical exercise and follow nutritious dietary guidelines.
- Implement employment support programs, including job training and career counseling, alongside marital and social support services.
- Create targeted mental health programs based on demographics and lifestyle factors, such as age-specific and lifestyle-focused initiatives. Support these programs with educational campaigns that highlight the connections between lifestyle factors and depression, ensuring both personalized support and widespread awareness.
